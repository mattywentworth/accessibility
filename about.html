            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>This website serves as a collection of examples demonstrating how digital features can be upgraded to promote accessibility for people with disabilities. Our goal is to inspire developers, designers, and content creators to consider accessibility as a core aspect of their work.</p>

            <h2>Why Accessibility Matters</h2>
            <p>Accessibility is not just a nice-to-have feature—it's a fundamental requirement for creating inclusive digital experiences. When we design with accessibility in mind, we create products that are usable by everyone, including people with disabilities.</p>
            <p>From screen reader compatibility to color contrast improvements, each feature upgrade showcased here addresses real barriers that prevent people from fully engaging with digital content.</p>

            <h2>How It Works</h2>
            <p>Each idea featured on this website includes a working demonstration that you can interact with. These demos illustrate both the problem being addressed and the proposed solution, making it easy to understand the impact of these accessibility improvements.</p>
